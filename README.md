## Starting Thoughts/ Pseudo Code

![Pseudo](./Pseudo.PNG)
As Time Went on This would have additional variables That i would have to consider. Such as, concatinating arrays based on preferences, as well as makeing a math function that would randomly choose based on length of the preference array.

## Description

I was able to apply JS logic into pre-existing code inorder to make a functional password Generator. For the most part all I added was the function that would actually determine preferences of desired passwords and write out a string to send back to get printed onto the page.
